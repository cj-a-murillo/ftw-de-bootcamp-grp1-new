### Key Insights
-   **High Customer Loyalty & Habitual Shopping:** The consistently high **Average Basket Size (10.11 products)**, combined with the dominance of staple items (**Banana** as the top reordered product and **Fresh Fruits** as the top aisle), indicates that customers heavily use the service for their regular, habitual grocery replenishment.
    
-   **Sunday Operations are Critical:** Transaction volume sharply peaks on **Sunday**, making this the most crucial day for operational staffing, logistics planning, and targeted promotional campaigns (e.g., weekend/pre-week specials).
    
-   **Data-Driven Inventory Focus:** Inventory management and stocking efforts should prioritize the **Fresh Fruits** and **Fresh Vegetables** aisles, as they represent the highest proportion of transaction volume.
